  <p>
    <strong>Welcome to Wisdom Circle Group (WCG)</strong>, a platform built by visionaries for visionaries â€” where the convergence of student brilliance, responsible innovation, and futuristic ideas form the foundation of every interaction. We are not just an eBook store; we are a growing community committed to knowledge, ethics, and the future of conscious civilization. By accessing, browsing, or using any service provided by WCG, you are agreeing to abide by our terms, which are carefully crafted not just to meet legal standards, but to reflect our deeper mission â€” to inspire, to protect, and to evolve.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our platform operates on the principles of <strong>transparency, data minimalism, and intellectual responsibility</strong>. This means we collect only what is necessary to provide a seamless experience â€” we don't believe in tracking every click or storing irrelevant data. When you sign up, purchase an eBook, or contact us, any information you provide is encrypted using modern protocols and stored securely. We do not sell or transfer your information to third-party marketers, political agencies, or profiling companies. WCG is a safe zone from surveillance capitalism and an ecosystem that respects your digital footprint.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every piece of content you see â€” whether it's a free article, premium eBook, research brief, or visual banner â€” is the result of hundreds of hours of effort from student authors, designers, and editors. These works are governed under full intellectual property rights. <strong>Unauthorized reproduction, resale, redistribution, mirroring, or AI scraping of any content is a direct violation</strong> of our terms and may lead to legal consequences including but not limited to account bans, take-down notices, cease-and-desist letters, and financial restitution.
  </p>

  <p>
    As part of our evolving platform, you may also encounter new services in beta â€” including forums, AI tools, audio lectures, and community-led events. Participation in such features is voluntary, and may be governed by separate supplemental terms. We strongly recommend reading every update notification we send to stay aligned with our community ethics.
  </p>

  <p>
    You also agree to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use the platform only for lawful, educational, and non-commercial purposes</strong> unless given explicit permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect all contributors</strong> regardless of background, age, identity, or beliefs.</li>
    <li><strong>Refrain from submitting misleading, harmful, plagiarized, or illegal content</strong> in any contact forms or uploads.</li>
    <li><strong>Notify us immediately</strong> of any bugs, errors, security flaws, or suspicious behavior that may impact other users.</li>
    <li><strong>Use any purchased eBook for personal use only</strong> and refrain from mass-sharing, printing, or uploading to unauthorized platforms.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The WCG team reserves the right to modify these terms at any time without direct notification. It is your responsibility as a conscious user to stay updated by periodically checking our <a href=\"terms.html\">Terms & Conditions</a> and <a href=\"privacy.html\">Privacy Policy</a>. If you disagree with any part of our terms, we advise discontinuing use of our services immediately to maintain mutual respect and compliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> While we strive to keep all content accurate and scientifically verified, WCG is not liable for any decisions made based on content found on our site. eBooks and articles are for educational enrichment and do not replace formal advice from certified professionals unless explicitly stated.
